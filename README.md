# Fast-Linear-Recurrence-Algorithm
A Python implementation of the algorithm from https://inria.hal.science/hal-02917827/document to compute the N-th term of any linear recurrence sequence in 2*M(d)*logN time, where M is the time needed to multiply two polynomials. In theory, this algorithm beats other approaches to solving this problem.
