# Fast-Linear-Recurrence-Algorithm
A Python implementation of the algorithm from https://inria.hal.science/hal-02917827/document to compute the $N$-th term of any linear recurrence sequence in $2M(d)logN$ time, where $M(d)$ is the time needed to multiply two polynomials of order $d$. In theory, this algorithm beats other approaches to solving this problem.
